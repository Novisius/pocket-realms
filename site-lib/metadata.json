have three methods of reproduction, one from the multiverse, one from the exoverse, and one unique to this plane.The first, unique to this plane, is autogenesis. The liquid metal pool in the heart of every hive periodically spawns thrum. The number spawned has increased over the course of the crashes, initially having been one at midnight and one at midday. At this point, one spawns roughly every three hours and twelve minutes.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260108175322.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20260108175322.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe second, the multiversal method, is parthenogenesis. Slivers are capable of laying eggs via asexual reproduction. This can only be done while the individual's cortisol levels are low to non-existent, otherwise known as the individual feeling safe and secure. There are, of course, exceptions or modifications to this if the hiveform is specialized for reproduction in some capacity. Three notable examples being Sliver Queen, The First Sliver, and Hatchery Sliver. The queen can simply do this regardless of state and hatchery overdrives this process.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260108175349.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20260108175349.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe third, the exoversal method, is oviparity. Specifically, utilizing externally fertilized parasitic ovipositors. Basically, xenomorphing people. Stabbing them with a specific tendrils that can extend from their beak-like 'faces' and implanting an embryo. It uses the genetics of the host to determine the color alignment and future adaptation (if any), technically the external fertilization is this process of utilizing the host's dna. If you are, at the time of being implanted, classified as a blue black being, then the sliver who emerges would either be colorless or blue black. The host will be unconscious for a day, due to adjacently injected toxins that quells the immune system and causes the host to believe they simply fell asleep rather than having been injected with an embryo, then it will develop over the course of ten days in the host, then spend five days after violently bursting from the host's torso to mature fully into a Thrum or fully adapted Sliver.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260108175457.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20260108175457.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"slivers.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":["pasted-image-20260108175322.html","pasted-image-20260108175349.html","pasted-image-20260108175457.html"],"createdTime":1767912726947,"modifiedTime":1767913410536,"sourceSize":2086,"sourcePath":"Slivers.md","exportPath":"slivers.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":10,"backlinks":["world-tree.html"],"type":"markdown"},"world-tree.html":{"title":"World Tree","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Pasted image 20260108175139.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20260108175139.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>A world tree planted by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Coin_Empire\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Coin_Empire\" target=\"_self\">Fomori</a> within the blind eternities, between the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Edge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Edge\" target=\"_self\">Edge</a> and the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Multiverse\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://mtg.wiki/page/Multiverse\" target=\"_self\">Multiverse</a>, each seeded with life and since left to their own devices.<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Eumidians\" href=\"eumidians.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Insectile sapients</a> and <a data-href=\"Humans\" href=\"humans.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Humans</a> had been taken from the Exoverse, while other <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Nantuko\" href=\"nantuko.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">insectile sapients</a> and Humans had been taken from the Multiverse.
